img1-5 are under the 'Charms' category
img6-8 are under the 'Stickers' category
img9-12 are under the 'Buttons' category
everything should be .jpg?
the letters in the name (eg. img1b) indicate which images are in the same set and should be considered multiple images for the same product (but possibly different options)
name and specs I can go in and write (dunno how many of these products will actually get implemented so its prob easier to just write on the fly than have a list of item name and specs)
