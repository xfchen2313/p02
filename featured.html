				<h2>Summer Sale Begins!</h2>
				<p>The summer season has begun! What better way to kick off the summer during the strangest times than with a sale? By using the code WEBSUMMER20 you can receive 10% off all orders! This code is reusable so feel free to use it all summer for your retail therapy needs. Summer is the time to shop and have a good time with friends and this summer will be no exception, even if it's from the comfort of home. Enjoy a piece of the convention experience with some summer sales!</p>
				<p>This year has been difficult for artists and convention-goers alike with the current pandemic shutting down large gatherings such as conventions. Even though, I haven't been part of the convention scene for very long, I miss being able to interact with friends, fellow artists, and attendees who share similar interests. While there have been many virtual conventions and artist spotlights, the con experience is something that is difficult to replicate online.</p>
				<p>To all those waiting for the day that they can go out and attend conventions safely once more, I'm with you. Until then, we can only do our best to stay safe, stay kind and sit tight.</p>

				<h2>Merch Update 6.05</h2>
				<p>Nyaaa! Utapri Gashapon charms are officially on sale! Since the protoype design was drawn last Inktober these charms have been a long time in the making. Featuring the cast of QUARTET NIGHT, these charms make for a nice keychain to show the world who your best boy is (and hope he comes home)!</p>
				<p>Initially, I drew Ai as part of Inktober 2019 for the custom theme 'gacha'. The small Discord friend server I'm in decided to make our own daily themes that year using suggestions from any member who had ideas. The feedback from the initial design was unexpectedly positive so I decided to design the rest of the members of QUARTET NIGHT.</p>
				<p>Maybe one day I'll draw STARISH and HEAVENS. </p>

				<h2>Merch Update 5.20</h2>
				<p>At long last the Eeveelution Hanafuda set is complete! Beginning with Espeon and Umbreon, the Kanto trio, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, soon joined the series and finally the Sinnnoh duo, Leafeon and Glaceon, joined with Sylveon. </p>
				<p>Ever since I learned how to play Hanafuda during my exchange trip to Japan, I've loved the design of the cards and wanted to design something inspired by them. And what better than to do that with Pokemon, something that I've loved since childhood? It was a fun challenge figuring out which Eeveelution suited which card best and digging around the Internet for berry tree pictures to incorporate more of the Pokemon world into the card designs (they're surprisingly hard to find)! I definitely had fun drawing all of these, though.</p>
