			<h1>About the Artist</h1>
			<p><em>"Hiya! So you want to hear my story, huh? Well, it all started at an ungodly hour early last year, you know, like all crazy ideas do... Just kidding! The actual story is a lot more mundane than that..."</em></p>
			<p>After attending anime events and conventions following her exchange trip to Japan, Nekomatan decided to try her hand in the exciting world of tabling at a convention. Together with her friend, giraffudon, the two decided to make their official convention debut at SFU Summer Festival 2019 following months of research, product design, and manufacturing. The convention was a success and Nekomatan vowed to table at more conventions the following year. Unfortunately, COVID-19 ashed those dreams but that didn't stop Nekomatan from coming up with new ideas or tinkering with table displays whenever she finds the time or insperation.</p>
			<p>Nekomatan considers her style still in the work in progress stage as she tries many styles and product types to find out what works and what doesn't. Her love of Japan and its language and culture remains a constant, however, and Japanese inspired elements appear in her art and her table display. Currently, her table design goal is to create a table display inspired by wooden ramen carts with a modern twist. </p>

			<p>When she isn't occupied by work, school or art/convention related things, Nekomatan spends her time playing Animal Crossing and mobile games such as Granblue Fantasy. Her favorite places in the world are Tokyo and Zurich and she hopes to be able to live in either of those places one day.</p>
